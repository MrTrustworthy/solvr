# Solvr

This is a basic Sudoku-Solver in Python I wrote when I was bored of solving Sudokus while on a train ride.
Solvr tries to solve Sudokus based on a process of elimination.
Solvr doesn't try to guess and will stop if it isn't able to find a solution by method of eliminating all possibilities.

Solvr is currently able to solve hard Sudokus (approx. 23 given numbers) most of the time.
